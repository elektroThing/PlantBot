# Plant Bot Control System

This README provides a detailed explanation of the Plant Bot Control System and instructions for interfacing with it using the RemoteXY service.

## Overview

The Plant Bot Control System is designed to automate and monitor plant care through a combination of moisture sensing, light level monitoring, and automated watering. It leverages the ESP32 microcontroller for its core operations and RemoteXY for its user interface, allowing for remote monitoring and control.

## Code Explanation

### Libraries and Definitions

```cpp
#include "Freenove_WS2812_Lib_for_ESP32.h"
#include <WiFiClientSecure.h>
#define REMOTEXY_MODE__ESP32CORE_BLE
#include <BLEDevice.h>
#include <RemoteXY.h>
#define REMOTEXY_BLUETOOTH_NAME "Plant-Bot"
```

- `Freenove_WS2812_Lib_for_ESP32.h`: Library for controlling WS2812 LEDs with an ESP32.
- `WiFiClientSecure.h`: Library for secure Wi-Fi client operations.
- `BLEDevice.h` & `RemoteXY.h`: Libraries for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and RemoteXY integration.

The `#define` statements set up the ESP32 for BLE communication and define the Bluetooth name as "Plant-Bot".

### RemoteXY Configuration

```cpp
#pragma pack(push, 1)
uint8_t RemoteXY_CONF[] = { /* Configuration data */ };
#pragma pack(pop)
```

This section includes the configuration data for RemoteXY, defining the user interface elements like sliders, switches, etc.

### Global Variables and Pin Definitions

```cpp
struct RemoteXY {...};
#define LIGHT_SIG 0
...
```

Defines a structure `RemoteXY` for RemoteXY variables and constants for pin assignments on the ESP32.

### Setup Function

```cpp
void setup() {
  RemoteXY_Init();
  Serial.begin(115200);
  ...
}
```

Initializes communication with RemoteXY, configures serial communication, sets up pins, and initializes peripherals like LED strips.

### Main Loop

```cpp
void loop() {
  update();
  ...
}
```

Contains the primary logic for moisture sensing, LED control, and pump activation based on the RemoteXY interface.

### Update Function

```cpp
void update() {
  RemoteXY_Handler();
  ...
}
```

Handles the RemoteXY communication and updates sensor readings for light and moisture.

## Interfacing with Plant-Bot

To interface with the system using RemoteXY, follow these steps:

1. **Install the RemoteXY App**: Download and install the RemoteXY app on your smartphone. Available on iOS and Android.

2. **Connect to the ESP32**: Open the app and connect to the ESP32 using BLE. The ESP32 should appear as "Plant-Bot" in your Bluetooth devices list.

3. **Control Interface**: Once connected, you will see the user interface defined in the `RemoteXY_CONF` array. This interface allows you to:
    - View current moisture and light levels.
    - Adjust the moisture threshold for watering using a slider.
    - Toggle the pump on or off.

4. **Monitoring and Control**: Use the app to monitor real-time data from the sensors and control the watering system. Adjust the threshold slider to set the desired moisture level for automatic watering.

## Conclusion

The Plant Bot Control System is a comprehensive solution for plant care automation. By following the instructions above, you can effectively interface with the system using RemoteXY to ensure optimal care for your plants.
